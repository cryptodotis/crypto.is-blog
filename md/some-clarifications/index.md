# Some Clarifications

I want to take the opportunity to clear things up, or at least present the facts regarding @ex\_wl\_arch and The Crypto Project from our perspective. 

On August 28, [this tweet][1] was made to The Crypto Project. I was quite confused as to what @ex\_wl\_arch was referring to and posted to IRC.  I scanned my email, checked for Github notifications, and IRC to see if there was something I or any of us missed.  After attempting to contact @ex\_wl\_arch through @mentions, we finally received contact via DM. I have been given zero proof that @ex\_wl\_arch is real or fake.  I can only confirm what is public, that we have been told we will receive source code this week, a thank you, and an ok to acknowledge this publicly.

What we need to do here is take a step back, ignore the issues surrounding Wikileaks and Openleaks, and look at what we really have.  This is simply about an author of source code, licensing it as BSD, and claiming they will hand it to The Crypto Project. We are not leaking or doing anything other than making open source code public.

The Crypto Project is in its infancy.  Whether @ex\_wl\_arch is real or not, we must approach the situation as though his/her claim is true.  If we place doubt, negativity, or speculate, we could paint a negative image for ourselves and the future individuals who will undoubtedly need help with anonymity, privacy, and security.

We have made the commitment to help @ex\_wl\_arch and will keep that commitment until we have confirmation from @ex\_wl\_arch that this is not real.  The chat logs between @ex\_wl\_arch will remain private unless he wishes them to be public, fake or real.  I will always honor a communication that is meant to be private.  I will not speculate, point fingers, or create added drama.  The last thing I would like to see happen is for all of this to have a negative effect on The Crypto Project, its people, their relationships, or any other negative outcome.  As usual, we will post any information we can, when we can.

Thank You and Good Luck,
Sir Valiance
