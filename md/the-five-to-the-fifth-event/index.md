# The Five to the Fifth Event

Over the next 5 days this week (8/22/2011 - 8/26/2011), The Crypto Project will be setting up 5 servers, 5 services, as well as creating 5 set up guides for each server, and 5 Fabric scripts to automate each deployment.  Of the five services, one will be an [anonymous remailer][5], one will be a [Tor node][1], another a [Tahoe-LAFS node][2], and the last two are still to be determined.  We should be posting a blog post as a recap for each day on what the experience was like to setup the node, tips, and more.  

We hope that by setting up these servers we can provide valuable resources to individuals worldwide.  Hopefully our guides and setup scripts will make it easier and inspire those out there to setup servers of their own.

To help out or sponsor a server, contact us via [Twitter][3] or donate to help fund the servers on [The Crypto Project Donations Page][4]. Stay tuned each day to see the progress!

Thank you,
Sir Valiance
