# The 5 to the Fifth Event

Over the next 5 days this week (8/22/2011 - 8/26/2011), The Crypto Project will be setting up 5 servers, 5 services, as well as creating 5 set up guides for each server, and 5 Fabric scripts to automate each deployment.  Of the five services, one will be a remailer, one will be a [Tor node][1], another a [Tahoe-LAFS node][2], and the last two are still to be determined.  We should be posting a blog post as a recap for each day on what the experience was like to setup the node, tips, and more.  

To help out or sponsor a node, contact us via [Twitter][3] or donate to help fund the servers on [The Crypto Project Donations Page][4]. Stay tuned each day to see the progress!

Thank you,
Sir Valiance
