# The Crypto Project: Newsletter One

In our first newsletter, we will be simply recapping the accomplishments of the past month.  The Crypto Project is just starting out and we are glad to have made such great progress already.  There are many active, intelligent, and involved individuals contributing documentation and guides, code, and setting up servers and services. So far, we have:

## Doubled the Number of Mixminion Nodes

When we started The Crypto Project, the [Mixminion](http://mixminion.net) network was dwindling.  Since then, the network has [doubled](http://www.noreply.org/mixminion-nodes/).  The Mixminion Thunderbird plugin is now on in a project as a [github repository](https://github.com/cryptodotis/mixgui). It needs updating and work, but it is a step forward. What we need now are more relays, more server exit nodes and developers to work on Mixminion code.

## Dyne:Bolic 3.0 Released

The [Dyne.org](http://dyne.org) hackers released the latest version of the dyne:bolic OS.  Find version 3.00 at [Dyne:bolic](http://www.dynebolic.org/).

## Convergence

A lot of the contributions and work has gone into [Convergence](http://convergence.io). We have setup our own notary at convergence.crypto.is and have 3 guides related to convergence in the [Guides Section](https://crypto.is/guides/). We also have two convergence notaries setup by project members which can be found on our [Network Section](https://crypto.is/projects/network/).  Individuals are also contributing patches and submitting bugs.

## The Guides Section

We currently have a [Guides Section](https://crypto.is/guides/) where 11 guides have been created and project members have begun to add content.  This is excellent progress and hope to continue this trend.  If you have questions or ideas for new guides, please contact us or add it to the wiki [Wishlist Section](https://wiki.crypto.is/page/md/interact/wishlist.md).

## Network

As mentioned previously, we have our [Network Section](https://crypto.is/projects/network/) that lists all of services The Crypto Project runs as well as the services run by project members.  If you would like to run a service or have already set one up, please contact us and/or add it to the list.

## Pynchon Gate Implementation

[Nick Mathewson](http://twitter.com/#!/nickm_tor) started working on a [Pynchon Gate (PDF)](http://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/publications/article-620.pdf) implementation, which can be found on the [github repository](https://github.com/nmathewson/pynchon-gate).  It doesn't send or receive email yet, but it might turn into something useful.  Pynchon Gate is a pseudonymous email system designed by Len Sassaman and Bram Cohen.  

The Project could use lots of help, including more development and review, a test suite for the current codebase, and more.  Please join in and contribute reviews or development.

## Code Audit Feed
The [Code Audit Feed](https://crypto.is/projects/audit/) has been under active development.  Currently the biggest contributions needed are the names of crypto, privacy, anonyminity and projects that can be [added to the database](https://github.com/cryptodotis/code-audit-feed/blob/master/setup.py#L96).  The project is nearing a public beta (along with a renaming - suggestions welcome), and could use web designers to start brainstroming a good web interface.

## Irssi-otr
DrWhax has been working on the [irssi-otr](https://github.com/cryptodotis/irssi-otr) project. The name should actually be changed, since it's not only irssi-otr which suffers from bugs; pidgin-otr, weechat-otr and xchat-otr suffer from the same bugs like the much discussed "/me" bug.  This means that if you are having an OTR chatsession and you are doing a "/me loves OTR", this won't be encrypted and will be sent in the clear, thus leaking requests and exposing that you are having an OTR chatsession. There are many more bugs which are not listed yet on the github repository.  If you ever encounter a bug, please fill a bug-report! Later this week DrWhax hopes to publish a blog post about OTR and the implementations of it.

## Recent Press and New Project Members

Since we had a little press from [Threatpost](https://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/behind-scenes-crypto-project-083011), [Slashdot](http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/08/31/0424251/The-Crypto-Project-Revives-Cypherpunk-Ethic), and more, the number of contributors, individuals on IRC, and the mailing list has exploded.  With the new members, we hope to receive more development on projects, services and servers setup, and the continued work on guides.  Glad to see all of the new handles!

## Establishing Roles

From the beginning, we hoped to allow the project to grow and define its structure as needed.  With the new influx of contributors it was a little chaotic at first to handle everyone, but now it seems that things have settled a bit.  As stated originally, we would one day like to be an organization that can fund developers, contributors, researchers and have established positions with The Crypto Project.  As of right now that point a long way away but we soon might need to define roles, email accounts, etc. for project members and distributing project responsibilities.

We hope that progress will continue to be made and that we see more development on projects, guides being created and updated, and see the number of services and servers in the network expand.

Thank You,
The Crypto Project
